# 🚀 SQL Interview Challenges: Data Engineer & Data Analyst

Welcome to my SQL Practice Repository! 
This repository contains my solutions to real-world SQL interview questions from top tech companies. I use these challenges to sharpen my data manipulation, aggregation, and analytical skills.

## 🏢 Companies Included
I have solved data scenarios based on business cases from:
- **Airbnb:** Pricing strategies and host earnings analysis.
- **Amazon (Prime Video):** Content engagement and viewership tracking.
- **LinkedIn:** User engagement scoring and content type performance.
- **Meta:** Ad performance, custom audiences, and cost per conversion.
- **Microsoft (Teams):** Data security, file sharing, and risk identification.
- **Stripe:** Loan repayment success rates and business revenue variability.

## 🛠️ Key SQL Skills Demonstrated
In these scripts, I have applied advanced SQL techniques to solve complex business logic, including:
* **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Structuring complex multi-step queries for readability.
* **Window Functions:** Using `PERCENT_RANK() OVER()` for percentile calculations.
* **Conditional Aggregation:** Utilizing `SUM(CASE WHEN ...)` and `AVG(CASE WHEN ...)` for pivoting and targeted metrics.
* **String Manipulation:** Applying `SPLIT_PART()` and concatenations (`||`) to clean and extract text data.
* **Date & Time Filtering:** Using `EXTRACT()`, `BETWEEN`, and date logic to analyze time-series data.
* **Complex Joins & Aggregations:** Joining Fact and Dimension tables (`fct_` and `dim_`) to generate meaningful business insights.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The SQL files are organized by company name. Inside each file, you will find the business question as a comment, followed by the optimized SQL query.
